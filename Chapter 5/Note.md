# Energy and Power Efficency
## Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)
- Total power usage within Datacenter vs IT Power (computing and network equipment)
- Most losses come from cooling

## Server Power Usage Effectiveness (SPUE)
- Total power usage of server (including Fans, power supply, volatage regulator) / Power usage of computing components (CPU, RAM, Dist, motherboard, ...)

## Power that goes to electric components is used for computing work
- Low utilization has less efficency than high utilization
- This is why when there is light load, load should be distributed to all servers instead of having them idling
- It's hard to scale-down WSCs during low-traffic period because data resilience, and data replication
