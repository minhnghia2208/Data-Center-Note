# Datacenter basics
## Datacenter tier list:
Tier 1: Have a single path for power distribution, Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS), and cooling distribution, without redundant component

Tier 2: Like above but with additional redundency components (N + 1), for availability

Tier 3: Have one active and one alternative power. Each path has redundant components which provide redundency even during mantainance

Tier 4: Like above but with one more path of active/alternative power. It is supposed to tolerate equipments failures without affecting the loads

Most datacenters belong to tier 3-4

## Datacenter Power System
### Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)
- Have a back battery in case of power outage and back generator starting (usually in 10-15s)
- Stabilize in case of power spike
### Power Distribution Units (PDU)
### Alternative: DC Distibution

## DataCenter Cooling System
