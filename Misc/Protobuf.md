# Protocol Buffer (protobuf)
    - Protobuf is a mechanism to serialize and deserialize data for between systems communication
    - Data is serialized into binary before transfer and deserialized into object after receiving
    - It is faster and lighter than JSON, XML because data is transfer in binary instead of text
