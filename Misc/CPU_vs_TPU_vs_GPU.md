## Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- There are 2 parts:
    1. Arithmetric-logic unit (ALU): logical computation such as sum, subtract, AND, OR, ...
    2. Control Unit: controls ALU, memory, I/O
- How it works:
    1. CPU takes request (input)
    2. Go to memory for processing instructions
    3. Delegate to ALU or other processors
    4. Get data from step 3 and return it (output)

## Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
- Use for massive amount of parellel processing
- NVidia created CUDA platform so we can use GPU for general computing
- Great for Machine Learning

## Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)
- Google's proprietary AI processor
- Compare to GPU, it as lower precision. But it's acceptable in Machine Learning training
- So more cost efficient
